# Learning Ceedling

Experiments with using Ceedling for unit testing.

## Resources

First tests are based on material from a pdf called "How to Use Ceedling for Embedded Test-Driven Development" written by Matt Chernosky.

This pdf can be downloaded from [electronvector.com](http://www.electronvector.com/how-to-use-ceedling-for-embedded-test-driven-development) if you are alright with sharing your contact information.

Resource to go through in a near future is [ThrowTheSwitch/Ceedling](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Ceedling/blob/master/docs/CeedlingPacket.md)

## Installation Notes

Ruby is required to run Ceedling. I currently use Ruby 2.7.3-1-x64 on my Windows 10 PC. Installer can be found at [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
